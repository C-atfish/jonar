# Simple portfolio idea:
use three.js
make a simple room in blender or something.
Have items the user can click on, when clicked, moves the camera close up
example: could click on a oppslagstavle, camera moves close to it, and it shows links to all my projects.
What other objects could be there and clickable?

Maybe the blinds close when clicked on or lamp jiggles or some other small easter eggs
